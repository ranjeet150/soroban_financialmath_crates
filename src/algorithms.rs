//! High-precision approximation algorithms over [`Wad`]-scaled fixed-point

//! ### Contributor note
//! The signatures, domains, error conditions, and doc-comments below are the
//! accepted public API surface — do not change them without opening a
//! design discussion first. The **bodies** are intentionally left as
//! `todo!()` and tracked as individual open-source issues:
//!
//! | Function         | Suggested issue difficulty |
//! |------------------|-----------------------------|
//! | [`sqrt`]         | Medium (Newton-Raphson, well-trodden ground) |
//! | [`ln`]           | High (range reduction + Taylor series + error bounding) |
//! | [`exp`]          | High (range reduction + Taylor series + overflow guarding) |
//! | [`geometric_mean`] | Medium (composes `ln`/`exp`, mostly wiring + edge cases) |
//!
//! All of these MUST remain free of floating-point instructions
//! (`f32`/`f64`) — Soroban's Wasm host does not guarantee deterministic
//! float rounding across validator implementations, so every step has to be
//! expressed in checked integer arithmetic on the underlying `i128`.
